## How do I participate?

We'll send you an email - if you didn't receive it, please contact us, so we can add you to our list (which will only be used in that first week to keep you updated about these social events).
<!--The day programm of the orientation week will probably be not of much interest to you since it will only be held in German.
But you can definitely participate in the evening programm that we planned for the orientation week which is a great way to meet new people and socialize.
-->
If you want to tag along for the City paper chase and dinner please notify us beforehand so we can reserve enough space at the restaurant.
<!--
To keep you updated on the programm, you can follow us via this [Web-App](https://fs-coli-sb.lineupr.com/erste-woche-20192020).
