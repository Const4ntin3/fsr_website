## What do we do?

- from time to time we organize an  "**AllYouCan-Breakfast**" (waffles, coffee and more in the CoLi-Foyer (building C7.3))
- from time to time organize a **games-night** (or rather games-evening)
- once per year organize the **CoLi-summer party** (with barbecue and such)
- once per year help with the **open day (German: Tag der offenen TÃ¼r)** and inform about CoLi
- assist coli students with **questions and problems**
- **represent their interests** within the structures of the department (e.g. examination board) and the university
- organize the **Linux-** and **LaTeX- introduction course**
- and last but not least **offer orientation** to first-semesters (including an orientation week each winter term before the lecture start)

## Is is possible to join us?

Yes, very much so!
The students council is elected each year (typically in spring) by all coli students.
Anyone who wants to can stand for election.
We are always happy to welcome new commited people!
