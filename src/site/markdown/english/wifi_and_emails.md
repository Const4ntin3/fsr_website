This site describes how to connect to the wifi on campus, use the university VPN and the two email addresses (`stud` and `coli`).


## email addresses

Two mail addresses: what for?

- UdS wide mail `@stud.uni-saarland.de`
- coli mail `@coli.uni-saarland.de`

Both are also used to access other services like LSF/HISPOS, wifi on campus, VPN, the coli servers among others. See below for more details.

### UdS wide mail: `@stud.uni-saarland.de`  
By enrolling at Saarland University as a student (often abbreviated with UdS for 'Universit√§t des Saarlandes') you will be assigned a student mail address ending in `@stud.uni-saarland.de`.
With this email and password you can authenticate yourself as a student of the UdS and therefore access many UdS-wide services such as WiFi on campus (eduroam), VPN, MS Teams, Moodle, [LSF/HISPOS](https://www.lsf.uni-saarland.de) (registration for courses and examinations, grade overview).  
You will also receive emails regarding university-wide news such as a reminder to re-register for the next semester.
Your username is the part before the `@` symbol: a person with name 'Jane Doe' would probably have a username something like `s8jado`, `s9jado` or nowadays `jado00005`.

### coli mail: `@coli.uni-saarland.de`  
This is different from the university-wide email.
As of now (May 2021) you don't get such an account by default, but have to apply for it (see the [coli-wiki](https://wiki.coli.uni-saarland.de/public/First-Steps) and specifically the [application form](http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/sg/coli-account.pdf) linked there).
The email with `lst` instead of `coli` (i.e. `@lst.uni-saarland.de`) is used as an alias.
The username for a person named 'Jane Doe' would probably be something like `janed` or `doe`.
The coli-mail comes with certain mailing lists like `students@coli` or `everbody@coli`. Information relevant to all coli students or everyone of the LST department (including staff members and lecturers) will be announced that way: for instance job offers and announcements of talks.
The coli mail is used to access the coli-servers.

## HiZ: Wifi on campus, VPN and uni student email

The [HiZ](https://www.hiz-saarland.de/start), short for Hochschul-IT Zentrum, is responsible for university-wide IT infrastructure like wifi, VPN and the student mail adresses (`stud.uni-saarland.de`).
As of today (last accessed: May 2021), most of the information seems to be only available in German sadly.

To access the **eduroam** wifi on campus, check out the [corresponding site (German only)](https://www.hiz-saarland.de/dienste/wlan). Basically you can use your `stud.uni-saarland.de` mail (see previous section) and the corresponding password.  On the HiZ page (on the right) there are installation instructions as PDFs for different operating systems available. 

- username is your *full university mail but with the `stud.` part omitted* (e.g. instead of `abcde@stud.uni-saarland.de` use `abcde@uni-saarland.de`)
- password is your university mail password (the password for your `@stud.uni-saarland.de` address)

In some cases you might need the [eduroam-CAT tool](https://cat.eduroam.org/) and for Linux/Android you might need to first download a certificate (a `.crt` file from `https://www.pki.dfn.de/wurzelzertifikate/globalroot2/`).

If you are not on campus, but need access to certain UdS-internal sites (or to get access to certain paywall-hiden papers the university owns), you can use a **VPN** ('Virtual private network' see [Wikipedia](https://www.hiz-saarland.de/dienste/wlan)). This is also described on the HiZ website and again only in German: [this site](https://www.hiz-saarland.de/dienste/vpn) describes the details. Basically, you download the software *Cisco AnyConnect*, type `asa1.uni-saarland.de` or `asa2.uni-saarland.de` as the server address and then use your username (the part before the `@`) and password of your uni mail address.   By the way, the VPN allows you to access more sites of the [coli wiki](https://wiki.coli.uni-saarland.de/public/).

The HiZ also provides information regarding how to add your **student email address** (see previous section) to an email software such as Thunderbird.
Again [the site](https://www.hiz-saarland.de/dienste/email) seems to be only available in German.
