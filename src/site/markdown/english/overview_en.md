**For first-semesters:**
The student council organizes an orientation week every winter term before the lectures start. For more information visit [this site](../home/erstis_en.md).

Additionally we usually offer propaedeutic courses (short introductory courses) on Unix and LaTeX at the beginning of each winter term. Check out the respectives sites on this website regarding LaTeX ([this](latex_en.html) and [this](latex_tut_en.html)) and Unix (only German so far: [here](../1x1/unix.html) and [here](../1x1/unix_tut.html)).
<!-- or directly checkout the slides of the [LaTeX introduction](../pdf/LatexPraes_eng.pdf) -->
